            The Great Emu War. This historical event occured in 1932. 
            The Emus in Australia were becoming a bit of a nuisance, 
            destroying crop destruction and whatnot. The Australian 
            military decided it wouldn't be too hard to get rid of 
            them. So, they tried, and failed horribly. There were 
            several attempts, but all of them were in vain. They 
            had killed a ton of emus, but the people of Australia 
            were making a mockery of their military, because it
            was so hard for them to kill these large, flightless 
            birds.
