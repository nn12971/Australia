        <p class="text1">Australia: <br> 
            Founded on January 1, 1901. <br> 
            Language spoken is English. <br>
            Current population is 25.69 million. <br> 
            And these 25.69 million people are my favorite people ever.
            Australia is perhaps the greatest country in the world. They have 
            some of the best animals, the funniest and best people, and the 
            funniest humor. Those who live there are in constant danger, which 
            is why I thoughly respect those who live there. Everything in
            Australia is trying to kill you, yet they are all so chill about it
            which is absolutely hillarious to me.
